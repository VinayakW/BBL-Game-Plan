# Solution -
From the above analysis following points should be considered while deciding the game plan for winning the games -

1. As it is seen that the player of the match has a good contirbution in winning the games, the player winning most player of the match titles for the team must be put on priority.
2. As far as the decision based on toss is considered it is seen that the winning percentage of electing to field first after winning the toss is better than electing to bat first. So the team must elect to field first after winning the toss.
3. If in case the team loses the toss and is put to bat first then a good target is required to set on the board and picking wickets is must so that they can avoid the opponent to chase the target as the average of winning with respect to wickets is more than average of winning with respect to runs.
4. Whenever the team is performing in its home ground the winning rate is high. So while performing on the home ground the team should not implement major changes and play their normal game.
